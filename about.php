<p>
    The <em>Quebec Slang Translator</em> is a website which translates French Quebec 
    slang into English so that the English-speaking minority in Quebec is able to better understand
    the French that is often spoken in Quebec. Our purpose is to assure that speakers of all
    languages should be able to communicate with each other in some way or another, and we
    believe that this website is a step toward our goal.

    This project has been designed and programmed in 24 hours at ConUHacks IV by 
    Adelekan Faruq Aliu, Gia-Khang Ernest Nguyen, Kennan Hoa and Celia Cai as a submission
    for the themed challenge from Canada Heritage, Governement of Canada. HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript and PHP were the programming languages used to code this project.  
    Also, the team used GitHub to manage version control of the project.
