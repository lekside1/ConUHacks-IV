<p class="about">
    The <em><strong>Quebec Slang Translator</strong></em> is a website which translates French Quebec 
    slang into English so that the English-speaking minority in Quebec is able to better understand
    the French that is often spoken in Quebec. Our purpose is to assure that speakers of all
    languages should be able to communicate with each other in some way or another, and we
    believe that this website is a step toward our goal.

    for the themed challenge from Canada Heritage, Government of Canada. HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript and PHP were the programming languages used to code this project.
